Greetings!

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Information Science department at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/). I am privileged to receive guidance from Dr. Daqing He. My academic journey is sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh's iRiS Lab, where I work as a Graduate Student Researcher.

My research interests focus on the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. My goal is to develop machine learning systems that can understand and interpret human language to solve real-world problems.

Some of my notable projects include:
- [**Reason-to-Rank**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05168): Spearheaded the development of a reranking framework that enhances document retrieval interpretability through explicit and comparative reasoning. The ReasonRank framework, fine-tuned on LLaMA3.1 7B and Mistral models, improved NDCG@5 scores by 5%, surpassing state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 on the DL19 dataset.
- [**EquityGuard**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05180): Co-authored a framework aimed at reducing bias in clinical trial matching and medical question-answering tasks. Leveraging contrastive learning and model fine-tuning, we reduced bias scores and error rates across demographic attributes, ensuring fairness in patient-trial matching.
- [**RAG-RLRC-LaySum**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13179): Developed this framework for the BioLaySumm competition, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Reinforcement Learning for Readability Control. It significantly improved readability and factual accuracy in biomedical summaries.

I have also worked as a Machine Learning Intern at NetEase Cloud Music, where I improved user satisfaction and text generation accuracy through reinforcement learning.

My research interests include: Natural Language Understanding in Biomedical Areas, Multi-Model Generation, Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning, and Large Language Model Deployment.
