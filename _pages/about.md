Greetings!

I am a freshly minted Ph.D. student in the [Information Science department at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/). I am privileged to receive guidance from Dr. Daqing He and Dr. Ye Ye. My academic journey is sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh's iRiS Lab, where I work as a Graduate Student Researcher.

My main research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. 
My overarching research goal is to develop versatile machine learning systems that can understand and interpret human language to solve real-world problems.
Some of my notable work includes: 
[Transfer Learning in the EHR note at Pittsburgh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17257)

My research interests are: Natural Language Understanding in Biomedical Area, Multi-Model Generation, Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning,  Large Language Model Deploy.
My Linkedin and Github are here [Yuelyu Ji's Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuelyu-ji-265495154/), [Yuelyu Ji's Github](https://github.com/JoyDajunSpaceCraft).

[//]: # (Alzheimer's-related posts and comments from Reddit from 2010 to 2020 were collected and categorized according to the Health Information Want of Alzheimer's caregivers.)

[//]: # (At the data processing and model level, we used the GPT-2 based few-shot learning model to classify all the sentences in 200 labeled posts, and then put the sentences containing question marks or question keywords as questions, and the remaining identified sentences as background into SOTA's QA model for pre-training, and obtained a 40% The result of the QA model is then used as a question. The results of the QA model are then fed into SOTA's few-shot text classification task as a summary of the corresponding posts, and the F1 score up to 69%.)

[//]: # (Transfer learning based Covid-19 Readmission Risk Prediction)

[//]: # (Using the Covid-19 readmission patients Electronic Health Records in 16 different hospitals and using the NER model to extract the medical entities and match medical entities with unique identifier CUIs. Get most 1000 frequent CUIs and generate dataset.)

[//]: # (Using Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks &#40;DANN&#41; to predict different readmission rate in different hospitals and change the DANN as muti-source oriented task the AUROC result of the Multi-DANN up to 85% .)
