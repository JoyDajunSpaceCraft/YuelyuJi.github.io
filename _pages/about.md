Greetings!

I am a freshly minted Ph.D. student in the Information Science department at the University of Pittsburgh. I am privileged to receive guidance from Dr. Daqing He and Dr. Ye Ye. Currently, I also work part-time as a Machine Learning Intern at Neteast. My academic journey is sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh's iRiS Lab, where I work as a Graduate Student Researcher.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I obtained a Masters's degree in Information Science with a GPA of 3.68 from the University of Pittsburgh. My educational journey began at Nanjing Agricultural University, China, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems, graduating with a GPA of 3.50.

My main research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. My overarching research goal is to develop versatile machine learning systems that can understand and interpret human language to solve real-world problems. Some of my notable work includes:

Large language model fine-tuning with the reinforcement learning 
Using the RLHF method finetuned the Chinese version model and achieve the result of precise control of the generation from the GLM model. Improve the ROUGE-score and human evaluation in the controllability, relevance and informativeness of the new RLHF generation task.

Automatic Classification of ADRD Caregiversâ€™ Online Information Wants: A Machine Learning Approach.
Alzheimer's-related posts and comments from Reddit from 2010 to 2020 were collected and categorized according to the Health Information Want of Alzheimer's caregivers.
At the data processing and model level, we used the GPT-2 based few-shot learning model to classify all the sentences in 200 labeled posts, and then put the sentences containing question marks or question keywords as questions, and the remaining identified sentences as background into SOTA's QA model for pre-training, and obtained a 40% The result of the QA model is then used as a question. The results of the QA model are then fed into SOTA's few-shot text classification task as a summary of the corresponding posts, and the F1 score up to 69%.

Transfer learning based Covid-19 Readmission Risk Prediction
Using the Covid-19 readmission patients Electronic Health Records in 16 different hospitals and using the NER model to extract the medical entities and match medical entities with unique identifier CUIs. Get most 1000 frequent CUIs and generate dataset.
Using Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks (DANN) to predict different readmission rate in different hospitals and change the DANN as muti-source oriented task the AUROC result of the Multi-DANN up to 85% .
