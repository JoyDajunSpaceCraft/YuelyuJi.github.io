        - Automatic Classification of ADRD Caregiversâ€™ Online Information Wants, A Machine Learning Approach.
        - At the data processing and model level, we used the GPT-2 based few-shot learning model to classify all the sentences in 200 labeled posts, and then put the sentences containing question marks or question keywords as questions, and the remaining identified sentences as background into SOTA's QA model for pre-training, and obtained a 40% The result of the QA model is then used as a question. The results of the QA model are then fed into SOTA's few-shot text classification task as a summary of the corresponding posts, and the F1 score up to 69%.
